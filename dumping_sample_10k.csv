Monday was our regular trash day (Monday and Thursday).  Green Team did not dump the bin so we called and they said they did dump it on Tuesday at 8:35am and that ll the new trash in the bin and the illegal dumping of furniture around the bin were new since Monday and Tuesday.  The illegal dumpers are dumping in and around our bin almost every day and know when our trash and dumped and they come when it is empty and dump in it.  Can you stake out our apartment trash bin and catch this illegal dumping group.  They are organized  do it daily and dump large furniture every week and trash every day.  We put up warning signs and cameras and still no. help.  Please help us.  I called on Monday and spoke to the 311 office directly  and I am continuing online reports here.  The illegal dumpers several times weekly dump furniture next to our apartment Green Team dumpster in the public alley behind our apartment behind 633 South 8th St  San Jose  CA 95112. I am posting photos we took today of the furniture that they illegally dumped today before our regularly schedule pickup by Green Team (they only dump the dumpster  they do not pick up the illegally dumped furniture and illegally placed blue recycle bin full of trash that is not ours and the illegal dumpers put there). We never had a blue recycle plastic garbage bin. Today the illegal dumpers dumped furniture  bicycles  toys  a full brown trash bin that is not ours  cardboard boxes  clothes  and oil cans. We already added illegal video surveillance camera signs and fake surveillance cameras to try to discourage the illegal dumpers. Please stop this illegal trash dumping organized group that is dumping furniture and bags of trash next to our apartment Green Waste green recycle bin several times a week at our apartment dumpster in the public alley behind our apartment at 633 South 8th St  San Jose  CA 95112.
